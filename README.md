# Dotfiles
A collection of configs for my most used linux apps

# Why does this repo exists?
It so that when i distro-hop i can easly reconfigure my system with just one command

# What makes this repo different than other dotfiles repos
My repo includes configs with almost no tinkering, just some nice ease-of-use changes form the originals
made for people who want to get up and running without messing with config files too much
