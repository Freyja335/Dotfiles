# Dotfiles
A collection of configs for my most used linux apps

# Why does this repo exists?
It is so that when i distro-hop i can easly reconfigure my system without tweaking each app everytime

# What makes this repo different than other dotfiles repos?
My repo includes configs with almost no tinkering, just some nice ease-of-use changes form the originals
made for people who want to get up and running without messing with config files too much

# Warning!
My repo includes dotfiles made by others and slightly tweaked by me

That includes:
- [.conkyrc](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/conky/bspwm/doom-one-01.conkyrc?ref_type=heads)
